I was able to get throught this activity fairly easily becasue of the Melanie Walsh book that gave all the information on for loops. There was some trial
and error which I had a friend help me with but other than that it was a fun exercise. Coding has never really been fun for me but this sort of problem
solving is very rewarding.
